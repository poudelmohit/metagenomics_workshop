# Metagenomic Analysis of Environmental Samples
  This repository contains the pipeline for analyzing metagenomic data from environmental samples using various bioinformatics tools on a Linux system. The project involves quality control, read trimming, assembly, binning, taxonomic profiling, and visualization using open-source tools like FastQC, Trimmomatic, SPAdes, MaxBin, MetaPhlAn, and Krona.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is derived from the Data Carpentry workshop metagenomics tutorial. The workflow followed is inspired by the workshop but different command-line tools are used in this project, with different modifications.

## Folder Structure
  data/: Contains the raw and trimmed FASTQ files used in the analysis.
  
  assembled_files/: Stores the results of the metagenomic assembly.
  
  taxonomy_files/: Contains the taxonomic profiling results generated by MetaPhlAn.
  
  results/: Includes final visualizations, such as Krona plots, for easy interpretation.
  
  docs/: Summarized quality control reports and additional documentation.

## Notes
Due to the large file size (>100 MB), some files (such as raw reads and assembly results) are not available in this repository. You can generate these files by following the steps outlined in the workflow.

## Workflow Overview
1. Quality Control: FastQC was used to check the quality of the raw FASTQ files.
2. Read Trimming: Trimmomatic was applied to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences.
3. Assembly: SPAdes was used to assemble the reads into contigs and scaffolds.
4. Binning: MaxBin was used for metagenomic binning of the assembled sequences.
5. Taxonomic Assignment: MetaPhlAn was used for taxonomic profiling of the metagenomic samples.
6. Visualization: Krona was used to visualize the taxonomic profiles.

*All analyses were performed using a Linux HPC cluster environment, ensuring efficient processing of the data*
